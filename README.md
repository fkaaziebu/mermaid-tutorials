# Learning how to use Mermaid for Diagrams and Documentations

In every software developed, one way engineers end up talking to each other and transfering ideas here and there is by the use of diagrams and documentations.

It is important that as an engineer, you should be able to make diagrams that communicate your thought process as well as document what ever software you work on. This enables other engineers to understand and even pick up from where you left with minimal efforts or even implement everything in your documentation.

At the end of this tutorial, I should be able to design with mermaid and document my software with well informed and understandable diagrams.
